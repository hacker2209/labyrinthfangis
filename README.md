# labyrinthfangis

This is a Project from students out of the ICT-Campus

The aim is to get practise with Java and JavaFX coding.

Our Project is a simple Game in which a Player needs to catch another Player by simply touching him. 
For that one Player controlls with WASD and one with the arrow Keys.

Each Player can also throw Bananas to harm the other one.

Feel free to clone it and try it out!
